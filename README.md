##Description
I used logistic regression on publicly available data to test dense vs. sparse classification. There are two datasets One is for Breast Cancer from Wisconsin. This is a dense dataset with n>p. The second dataset is about Coronary Artery Disease. It dataset is more sparse, but n>p still.

##Where to Look
The code can be found in Dense vs Sparse Classification.ipynb and the interpretation of the output is in the Sparse vs Dense Classification.pdf and Sparse vs Dense Classification.pptx files.
